This sample app illustrates how the Vuforia cloud recognition feature works. 
The app searches an image database in the cloud to recognize certain book covers and, on successful match, displays information such as their prices and ratings.

To use this app:
1. Print the book cover images located at developer.vuforia.com/resources/samples/files
2. Point your device at any of the book cover images
3. When the book cover is recognized the price and rating for this book is displayed on top of the cover.
